# Green Hell VR website

Hey i'm thalium, former developper for [GHVR](https://greenhellvr.com/) at Incuvo.
I'm using for this project 4 languages :

- HTML
- SCSS
- CSS
- JS

The SCSS is an easier way to write CSS files, then the SCSS file is recompiled (translated) into a .css file.

_Please respect my work and don't stole it (except if you work for Incuvo (they actually really stole my work lol)), i would appreciate it!_

## Checklist

- [x] Getting >95% of [performance](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) for PC and >80% for phones
- [x] Cross-platform (phone compatible)
- [x] Respect the initial design
- [x] Split the navbar to be used anywhere
- [ ] split the CSS file to allow async loading and to also use the navbar anywhere else
- [ ] Create Multi-resolutions images for low bandwidth
- [x] Finished
- [x] Published xD

I also want to use the less JS i can for people who don't have JS enabled.  
_( I may have stolen ~~all the~~ some images from the official website, sorry ;P )_
_(edit: they actually don't care as they really got my suggestion on their official website lol)_
